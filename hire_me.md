I help organisations to build effective development teams by adopting modern software engineering practices.

My preferred way to work is to augment a team as a developer/coach, in order to drive improvement from the inside.

[Contact Me](contact) for my availability and rates.

Below are examples of some of the areas I can advise on:

### Test-driven Development

* An effective Red/Green/Refactor cycle
* Faster test feedback
* Writing fast, clear and more maintainable tests

### Automated Testing

* Adding tests to a legacy codebase
* Speeding up a slow test suite
* Avoiding fragile tests

### Workflow

* Making effective use of Git and GitHub
* Techniques to avoid difficult merge conflicts

### Architecture

* Decoupling from frameworks
* Making use of Service Objects

### Code Review

* Introducing a strong culture of code review
* Providing feedback

### Refactoring

* Restructuring code when there are no tests
* Improving code without fear of introducing defects

### BDD (Behaviour-Driven Development)

* Improving collaboration
* Specification by Example
* Executable Specifications (e.g. Cucumber)

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment

* Reducing cycle time
* Deploying with confidence

### Automated Code Quality

* Measuring test coverage
* Verifying coding style
* Detecting code smells
* Identifying security issues
