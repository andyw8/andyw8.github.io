## Previous Post: [My Coding World Tour](http://blog.andywaite.com/2013/09/14/coding-world-tour/)

I announced plans for my Coding World Tour in a [previous blog post](http://blog.andywaite.com/2013/09/14/coding-world-tour/). The next challenge is to make sure people know about it.

Other than a couple of posts on Twitter and a share on LinkedIn, I haven't yet done much promotion. This post describes my next steps for spreading the word.

## Personal Network

I know a handful of people in some of the cities on my list, so I'll be asking them to share my post with their local contacts.

##Â Regional User Groups

Every city I plan to visit has a least one Ruby or Rails user group. I think these will probably be my best bet for finding coding opportunities:

  * New York City: [NYC.rb](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-rb/)
  * Boston: [Boston Ruby Group](http://bostonrb.org/)
  * Chicago: [ChicagoRuby](http://www.chicagoruby.org/)
  * Seattle: [Seattle.rb](http://www.seattlerb.org/)
  * Portland: [Portland Ruby Brigade](http://pdxruby.org/)
  * Atlanta: [Atlanta Ruby Users Group](http://www.atlrug.com/)
  * Dallas: [Dallas Ruby Brigade](http://www.dallasrb.org/)
  * Austin [Auston On Rails](http://austinonrails.org/), [Austin.rb](http://austinrb.org/)
  * Toronto: [Toronto Ruby Brigade](http://www.meetup.com/torontoruby/), [ruby-toronto](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ruby-toronto)
  * San Francisco: [San Francisco Ruby Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/), [SF Rails](http://www.meetup.com/SFRails/)

It might seem wrong to focus on Ruby, but it has an incredible community. Also, many Ruby developers are polyglot programmers, so it may lead to a chance of exploring other languages.

## Ruby Forums

These forums are full of enthusiastic developers:

  * [Ruby Rogues Parley](http://parley.rubyrogues.com/)
  * ThoughtBot Prime forum

## Individual Companies

There are a number of companies I admire who I'd like to spend a few days with, so I may approach them directly, but I'm going to hold off and see what offers I get first.

## Other Publications

These would be harder to get a mention on, but would be great publicity:

  * [Ruby5 podcast](http://ruby5.envylabs.com/)
  * [RubyRogues podcast](http://rubyrogues.com/)
  * [RubyWeekly](http://rubyweekly.com/)
