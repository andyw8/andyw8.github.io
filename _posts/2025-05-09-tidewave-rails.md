Tidewave is a new MCP tool avilable for Rails and Phoenix.

Tidewave comes from [Dashbit](https://dashbit.co), co-founded Jose Valim. He is creator of Elixir, and was well-known in Rails world prior to that.

## MCP

Introduced Nov 2024 by Anthropic. "“USB-C port of AI applications”,"

Can be used with chat, or by editors (agents)

The MCP protocol standardizes a way for LLMs to make use of external tools.

MCP in production?

## Parallels to LSP

I'm a contributor to the Rails add-on for Ruby LSP.



One of the most interesting aspects of the Rails add-on is that provides a direct connection to

Human -> Editor -> LSP -> Rails Server
LLM -> Editor -> MCP -> Rails Server
