I've ordered one of these 250GB FireWire drive from
[Insight](http://www.insight.com).

It's Â£245 which is a great price for a drive that size, especially FireWire. In
fact it's cheaper than a standard internal drive of the same spec. I suspect
it's a misprice but hopefully they won't realise!

I plan to use it for storing music using the lossless
[FLAC](http://flac.sourceforge.net/) format. It should
hold about 750 CD albums.
