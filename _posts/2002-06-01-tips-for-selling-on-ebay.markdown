* The longer your auction runs, the more the exposure it should get so always run
10-day auctions. Start the auction around 10pm on a Thursday night, then you
will get full exposure over two weekends. Most bids come in the last half hour
or so of an auction, and Sunday is a busy night when lots of people use the web.

* Use HTML to space out your listing. You don't need to do any fancy colours or
fonts, but at least use linebreaks (BR tags) to break things up. There's nothing
worse than 20 lines of text with no spacing in between.

* Ensure that any potential bidders can easily calculate the total cost including
shipping. If you say 'Buyer Pays Actual Shipping Cost' or 'e-mail for shipping
details' that will just put people off.

* Include your e-mail address (as a 'mailto' link) so that people don't need to
use eBay's annoying contact form.

* Likewise for payment methods.

* If you a selling a complex item (e.g. a DVD player) it may be cleaner to link to
the manufacturer's spec page rather than copying and pasting it all.

* Take clear photos, preferrably with a decent digital camera rather than a
webcam.
