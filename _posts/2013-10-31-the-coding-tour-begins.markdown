So after the past several months of planning, and a few hectic weeks of moving out out of my apartment, I've at last set off on my World Coding Tour. I'm writing this from a hotel room in Boston, where I'll be visiting [ThoughtBot](http://thoughtbot.com/) tomorrow.

I've had an awesome and enthusiastic response to the tour, and I'm grateful to everyone who's helped spread the word, especially Corey Haines and Avdi Grimm, who helped to spread the word. I've had offers from all over the US. Rather than try to arrange every date up front, I'm going to schedule as I go. RubyConf is coming up this weekend, so that should be a good opportunity to find some companies to visit.
