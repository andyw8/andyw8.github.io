Got my test marks through from last semester today.
I already knew them roughly but these are the official ones:

```
Class  Title                       Result  %   Credits
------------------------------------------------------
11650  Mathematics 1b              Exempt  81  1.5
12133  General Physics 1           Pass    68  1.0
12156  Classical Physics           Pass    70  2.0
53101  Introduction To Statistics  Pass    67  1.0
```

The pass mark is 40% so I feel I've done quite well.

I'm not sure why Maths is the only one which says 'Exempt', since I got
exemption from them all.
