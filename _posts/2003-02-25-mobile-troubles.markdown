I've got an annoying problem with my mobile (Nokia 8310). I've not been able to
receive text messages for almost a week, yet every other function works fine - I
can send texts, make and receive calls, but for some reason texts just aren't
coming through.

So if anyone has texted me lately and had no response, give me a phone or email
if it's important.
