title: Ruby and Rails Resources for Intermediate to Advanced Developers
layout: post
---
A [recent post] on Reddit asked about how an experienced developer can improve their Rails knowledge.

There's an abundance of resources online for those looking to pick up the basics of building a Rails app.
But once you get beyond that, finding good quality content takes some effort.

I've been writing Rails code professionally for around six years.
In this post, I've listed the resources which have been most useful to me over that time.

None of these resources are free.
Paying for them is a high-return investment in yourself.
If you work as an employee of a company, most will have a training budget per employee, so ask them to contribute.
