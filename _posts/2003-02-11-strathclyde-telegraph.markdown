I'm going to be doing some work on the [Strathclyde Telegraph](https://web.archive.org/web/20030612171213/http://www.s-t.org.uk/) web site. I've been
looking into some Content Management Systems:

[CoFax](http://www.cofax.org/). It's a Java web-app which runs on the Jakarta platform (from the Apache
group). It seems powerful and is used on a number of fairly big US newspaper
sites, but the documentation seems incomplete and outdated. I went through the
setup instructions step by step but couldn't get it to install. So instead I'm
using:

[Props](http://props.sourceforge.net). It's not as powerful as CoFax but should do for the Telegraph. It's
written in PHP and uses mySQL so it's an environment I'm a bit more comfortable
working in.
