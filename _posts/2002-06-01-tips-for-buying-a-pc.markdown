For first-time buyers.

* An AMD-based system is almost always better value for money than Intel

* Although packages with a large amount of bundled hardware or software (e.g.
digital camera, scanner) may seem like good value, generally the extras are of
low quality. The software is often cut-down or past-season versions

* Don't buy anything smaller than a 17" monitor

* Make sure the hard drive is at least 7200RPM

* Get a CD writer or DVD writer for backups or transferring files between PCs -
floppy drives are virtually obsolete

* Get at least 256MB of memory if you will be using Windows 2000 or Windows XP

* You only really need a 3D graphics card if you will be playing games

* Support from small local PC shops will generally be poor. The system prices may
seem attractive but the components are often low quality

* If you plan to get broadband internet access you'll need a network card
