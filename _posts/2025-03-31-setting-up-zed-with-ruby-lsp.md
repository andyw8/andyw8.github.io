title: "Setting up Zed with Ruby LSP"

[Zed](https://zed.dev) is a modern, high-performance code editor that's gaining popularity. After several years of using VS Code, I've been trying it out for writing Ruby and I've been impressed. And their close [collaboration with Anthropic](https://zed.dev/blog/zed-ai) makes for an strong contender to VS Code derived editors such as [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com).

In this post you'll learn how to set up Ruby LSP with Zed, and how to troubleshoot if things aren't working. I'll also share some alternatives for features that aren't currently available in Zed.

# Setting up Ruby Support

Zed's Ruby support comes from the [official Ruby extension](https://github.com/zed-extensions/ruby), created by [Vitaly Slobodin](https://bsky.app/profile/vitallium.bsky.social). You can enable it through `zed: extensions`.

As with all Zed extensions, it is written in Rust. Its documentation can be found [here](https://zed.dev/docs/languages/ruby), as part of the official docs.

# Configuring Ruby LSP

Zed has good support for the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), meaning there's a lot of tooling already available that can be used.

For Ruby, Zed defaults to using [Solargraph](https://solargraph.org) as its language server for Ruby.

My preference is to use [Ruby LSP](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp), since I'm a [contributor](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp/graphs/contributors). It can configured in Zed's settings as follows:

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "Ruby": {
      "language_servers": ["ruby-lsp"]
    }
  }
}
```

I've noticed that some configuration changes don't seem to apply until you fully quit and reload the editor (`workspace: reload` isn't enough) so I suggest doing that.

To verify things are working, open a Ruby file, then choose `debug: open language server logs` from the command menu and open a Ruby file. You should see something like this:

![Ruby LSP startup](/assets/images/zed-ruby-lsp-startup.png)

If there are multiple language servers running, then you'll need to first select `ruby-lsp` from the menu at the top-left.

If ever it seems that Ruby LSP is not running, this is the first place to check for errors.

# Enabling Diagnostics

The Diagnostics feature is used by Ruby LSP to show possible errors as you type, as illustrated [here](https://shopify.github.io/ruby-lsp/#diagnostics).

The implementation uses *pull diagnostics*, a newer aspect of the LSP specification where the client requests diagnostics from the server, instead of the server notifying the client.

There is some [work in progress](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/19230) for supporting this, but until then there is a workaround as long as your project uses RuboCop.

First, a little background: RuboCop [introduced](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/usage/lsp.html) a language server in v1.53, and the Zed extension already has built-in support for it. This language server does _not_ use pull diagnostics, so it's compatible with Zed.

Normally when using Ruby LSP we don't need RuboCop's own language server since its built-in, but here it becomes a useful fallback. We can configure Zed such that we use RuboCop's LSP _only_ for diagnostics, and Ruby LSP for everything else. First, we'll disable `diagnostics` for Ruby LSP to avoid sending unnecessary requests:

```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "ruby-lsp": {
      "initialization_options": {
        "enabledFeatures": {
          "diagnostics": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then we'll add `rubocop` as a secondary language server for RuboCop:

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "Ruby": {
      "language_servers": ["ruby-lsp", "rubocop"],
    }
  }
}
```

Note: Although apparently not documented, it seems that the order is important as only the first language server entry is use for formatting.

If your project uses Standard rather than RuboCop then you can try [this branch](https://github.com/zed-extensions/ruby/pull/25).

# Global vs Local Settings

So far I've shown settings as being added to the Zed's global configuration.

If you only ever work on a single Ruby project, then it doesn't really matter if you all your settings are global. But many of us will work on codebases with different configurations, so having more granular control is often necessary.

You can add project settings to `.zed/settings.json` in your project directory. These settings will be merged with the global settings, so normally you'll only need a few lines of configuration.
For example, you might have some projects that use RuboCop but others that use Standard.

# Running tests

One very useful feature when using Ruby LSP in VS Code is [Code Lens](https://shopify.github.io/ruby-lsp/#code-lens), which adds a `Run in Terminal` link to each test, and shows the result in the integrated terminal.

This LSP feature is not supported by Zed, but we can use the poweful [Tasks](https://zed.dev/docs/tasks) feature to do something similar.

For example, to add a task for running Rails tests, we can create a `.zed/tasks.json` file:

```json
[
  {
    "label": "test $ZED_RELATIVE_FILE:$ZED_ROW",
    "command": "bundle exec rails",
    "args": ["test", "\"$ZED_RELATIVE_FILE:$ZED_ROW\""],
    "tags": ["ruby-test"]
  }
]
```

The test can be run by clicking on the `â–·` in the gutter, or with the Command-Shift-R keybinding.

# Advanced LSP Troubleshooting

It can be sometimes be useful see the underlying requests and responses for the language server. In the `debug: language server logs` window, click the second menu, then enable `RPC Messages`:

# What's Missing

- If you're coming from VS Code with Ruby LSP, you might notice some feature are not available. There's two main reasons behind this:

  - Some Ruby LSP features depends on custom behaviour in the VS Code extension. Those would need to be reimplemented for Zed within the Ruby extension.

  - Some parts of the LSP specification are not yet implemented in Zed.
You can follow [this](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/26916) Zed issue to learn more.

- Zed does not yet have a visual debugger, so if you're used to that in VS Code then it might be a little awkward to use [terminal-based debugging](https://st0012.dev/my-ruby-debugging-tips-in-2025). A preview of a debugger was recently [merged](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/13433). I haven't tried it yet but I expect that it eventually be usable for Ruby.

- Zed supports [Snippets](https://zed.dev/docs/snippets) but the Ruby extension doesn't yet have any. I have a [PR](https://github.com/zed-extensions/ruby/pull/53) in progress to add them.
