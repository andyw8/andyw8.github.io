There's no shortage of online content for learning.

I signed up for Safari a few years ago with special offer of a half-price
subscription, but even at full price I would say it's worth it.


Patrick McKenzie quote about books in investment article:

> Buying books a stupidly high ROI, assuming you read and get value out of them. This is true generally of programming books (which are criminally underpriced) and anything else which meaningfully bends the curve of your business or trajectory upward.

Likebook Reader


I already have a Kindle Paperwhite and an iPad mini. So why buy yet another
device?


Physically the device feels very similar to the Kindle.

It has no physical buttons other than Power.

The screen is slightly bigger, which is especially handy for books which contain
code samples.


There are some dubious ways to export from Safari to open formats.

"Readed" spelling


I've always used an iPhone so my experience of Android is limited.

The Google Play app store was already installed, so all I had to was sign in and then I could download the apps I wanted.


Highlighting in Safari Queue doesn't show up well. 

* By default it automatically shuts down after a certain period. With the Kindle, I'm used to opening it and my book being available immediately. I've tried setting it to stay on to stay on.
* A2 mode.
* The two apps that I most keen to have are Safari Queue and Pocket.
* The screen size is bigger than a Kindle Paperwhite.
* Ghosting
* App store
* Libby (Overdrive)
* Battery life

## Safari Queue

Limitations:

* Highlights are not visible. I think this is because the yellow used it too
  light when rendered on the e-ink screen.
* Dragging to highlight is tricky.

## Libby

Libby from Overdrive allows you to borrow e-books from your local library.
If you're in the US, you can apparently use Overdrive with a Kindle.

## Battery Life

One of the great things about Kindle devices is that they can last for weeks on
single charge.

The performance from the Likebook is reasonable but not as good.
