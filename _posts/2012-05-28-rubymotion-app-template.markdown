I've been trying out [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) lately, and I've created a simple template project with some sensible defaults to make it quick and easy to start a new app:

* Folders for models, views, controllers and vendored frameworks to encourage a Rails-esque layout convention
* Spec folder layout to mirror the app folder
* Support for [TestFlight](http://www.rubymotion.com/developer-center/articles/testflight/)
* Support for [CocoaPods](http://www.rubymotion.com/developer-center/articles/cocoapods/)
* Default values for app version and identifier
* Placeholders for configuring icons and device families
