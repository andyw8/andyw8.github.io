Recently I've aiming to do more [katas](http://codekata.com/), both in my personal time, and at [work](https://shopify.engineering/) in our [Deliberate Practice](https://github.com/97-things/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/blob/master/en/thing_22/README.md) group.

I noticed that whenever I was starting on a new kata, I was doing the same basic setup repeatedly before being able to write a first test. I also felt I missing some of the configuration that my other 'real' projects benefited from.

This led me to create [ruby-kata-template](https://github.com/andyw8/ruby-kata-template). Clicking on **Use this template** will give new a new blank project in seconds.

Take a look at the [README](https://github.com/andyw8/ruby-kata-template#readme) for a guide to the features it provides.
