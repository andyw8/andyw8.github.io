I'm thinking of changing course... nothing major, same uni, same department just
a slight chance in emphasis:

[MSci Physics with Visual
Simulation](https://web.archive.org/web/20030629183932/http://phys.strath.ac.uk/undergraduate/degrees.html#PVS)

It's still a broad Physics course, but with a bit of software development and
other computing classes thrown in. The choice of name is a bit odd, which is
probably why I didn't even consider it when applying.

Hopefully I can transfer for the beginning of 2nd year. The 1st year curriculum
is the same as what I'm doing already, except for Instrumentation which is
replaced by a slightly different class.

It's a 5 year course, but I hadn't ruled out doing an MSci after 4th year, so
it's doesn't bother me too much.
