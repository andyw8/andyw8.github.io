The replacement battery for my iBook arrived on Friday - 3 weeks after I
requested a replacement. Luckily I wasn't desperate for it.

It seems every time you deal with Apple it's an international experience. When I
first called up, I spoke to a Irish customer rep, then to a French technician,
and the label on the box it arrived in says The Netherlands. I'm sure this slows
down the ordering process substantially.
